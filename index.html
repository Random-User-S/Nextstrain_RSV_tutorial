    <h1>Nextstrain Tutorial</h1>

    <p>Nextstrain is a bioinformatic tool useful in the context of virology and infectious disease surveillance. It helps to create a phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis on a real-time scale.</p>
    
    <p>Nextstrain has two components: <strong>Augur</strong> and <strong>Auspice</strong>. Augur is used for the analysis while Auspice is a server that displays the phylogenetics and phylogeographics.</p>
    
    <p>This article will describe the process of using Linux/Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to use the tool and establish a real-time analysis.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>To follow this tutorial, you need to have the following installed on your PC:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</li>
        <li>Conda environment within Linux/WSL or Docker</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you already have these, then skip to the <a href="#installing-nextstrain">Installing Nextstrain</a> part.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisite Guide</h2>
    
    <h3>1) WSL Installation</h3>
    <p>Most individuals work with their personal laptops with a Windows operating system. Keeping that in mind, WSL can be used for this purpose.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, most bioinformatic tools are Linux-based. So, WSL is a common approach to utilize the Windows operating system to run Linux.</p>
    
    <p>The most popular Linux distribution is Ubuntu. The base system is about 1-2GB, but it needs 4-5GB of disk space to operate. You need a stable internet connection.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>To install the OS as a part of WSL, first open the command prompt. This can be done by pressing <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on the keyboard. Type <code>cmd</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Type <code>wsl --install</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Click ‘Yes’ on the dialogue box.</li>
        <li>Let the installation begin. Click ‘Yes’ on the dialogue box when prompted. Wait for the installation to complete.</li>
        <li>You can look at different distributions that can be installed using <code>wsl --list --online</code>. By default, Ubuntu is going to be installed, which is just fine for bioinformatics. For example, if you want Debian to be installed, you can type <code>wsl --install -d Debian</code> and finish the installation.</li>
        <li>Once the installation is completed, you have to restart the PC (it will also be mentioned if the installation was successful).</li>
        <li>After the restart, press the Windows key and type ‘ubuntu’ and open the Ubuntu app. Set the username as prompted. Set the password as prompted.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Congrats! You are an owner of a new operating system.</p>
    
    <p>To close the terminal, you can type <code>exit</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
    <p>To run your Ubuntu distribution in the terminal, you can open up the command prompt and type <code>ubuntu run</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. To log out of the shell, you can use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>.</p>
    
    <h3>2) Installation of Conda and Docker and Getting Started</h3>
    
    <p><strong>What is Conda?</strong><br>
    Conda is an environment. It is used to install all the packages in a project in an isolated environment so it does not interfere with other packages.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What is Docker?</strong><br>
    Docker has containers that help run an application with all its dependencies. It has higher resource usage though.</p>
    
    <h4>Conda:</h4>
    <p>To create a new environment, use the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>conda create -n nex</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Docker:</h4>
    <p>Install Docker Desktop from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/</a></p>
    
    <h3>Using WSL and PowerShell</h3>
    
    <p>Make sure that WSL is already installed.</p>
    
    <p>Install the Nextstrain CLI using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>Invoke-RestMethod https://nextstrain.org/cli/installer/windows | Invoke-Expression</code></pre>
    
    <p>Open Windows PowerShell. From PowerShell, you can download the Docker images with the command:</p>
    <pre><code>nextstrain setup –set-default docker</code></pre>
    
    <p>Let the installation complete.</p>
    
    <p>To check the installation, you should launch the Nextstrain shell using the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>nextstrain shell</code></pre>
